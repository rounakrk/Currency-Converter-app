Currency converter python web app with the help of API's and streamlit library for the front end part.

#### Here with the use of "Streamlit" library in python and use of api
Made a currency converter app in which 

* currency.py
> This python file helped to get all the available currency in the api provided and which can be accessed.

* main.py
> This is the main python file which contains the streamlit component too and calculate the value on based on the input provided.

#### The ouput that we got from the api in form of JSON
```json
{"USD_PHP":48.047499}
```

For using the api use these [link](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/)
* here go login and have your own api key which is free of cost
* then search through the documents or my python file and get the links which you want to use in your projects

Well in my case STREAMLIT library seems to work like a charm without worrying about the frontend here you can also add some html tags for more creative ideas
